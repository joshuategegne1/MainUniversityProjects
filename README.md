# MainUniversityProjects

Here you can see the major projects I have done in the first two years of my degree.

"Poster Project Y1" is my poster project that I did at the end of Year 1, where I used non-linear regression to fit an SIR model to coronavirus data. I performed numerical integration a system of 3 coupled differential equations via Python and applied the graphical Monte Carlo simulation to determine the parameters that minimise the residual sum of squares, and then wrote up my created my project on Latex where I discussed my results with a wide variety of graphs.

"Network Science Coursework Y2" is the project I did in the first term of Year 2 for Network Science. , I constructed code in a Python project to calculate the source edge centrality of all edges in a graph, which worked with the shortest paths between the nodes in the graph. Additionally I modelled the spread of an infectious disease across a network to look at key trends; each time I assessed the code efficiency and running time.

"Statistics Coursework Y2" is another project I did my first term of Year 2 for Statistics. I used R to model a genome sequence as a Markov chain, investigating how effective it would be to regard base pairs as being chosen independently of their surroundings with hypothesis testing and verified Wilksâ€™ theorem with the likelihood ratio statistic of the model parameters.

"Time Series Project Y2" is a group-based research project I did at the end of Year 2. We explored how we can fit stock data to a time series data model, conducted hypothesis tests to see how accurate our fit was, then used this forecast our data and make future predictions, using both R and Python, as well as a wide range of statistical theory.
